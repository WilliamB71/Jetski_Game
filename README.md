# | Skills Demonstrated |
Object-Oriented Programming: The code showcases my proficiency in OOP principles by utilising classes and objects to represent game entities such as the player's jet ski, obstacles.
Control Flow: The code demonstrates my understanding of control flow by utilising loops and conditional statements to control the execution of different parts of the game.
Pygame: I utilised the Pygame library, a popular choice for 2D game development in Python. This demonstrates my ability to work with game development frameworks and utilise their features effectively.

Features:
Jet ski movement and control
Collision detection with obstacles
Scoring system and game levels
Game state management for intro, main game and death screen
